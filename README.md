after the initial construction and having everything communicating with each other (which came together quite well after the demo), it was mainly styling and adding additional features.
media queries- works on mobile and desktop a distinct layout for each.

like button- an additional column in my database was created to add in a like button and have it display current likes.

delete button- added a button to delete the post with a DELETE route to remove the post from the database, this was the hardest to achieve having browse several sites to implement only to keep getting a 404 error but coming back the next day everything was fine, possibly due to the server being inactive at the time of testing.

sound effects- added to the buttons to go with the theme with 2 of the buttons having a rotating sound effect.

basic animations- added some animations to the buttons for hover effects and an animation on messages when they get updated.

in case my screenshots don't come through i have made a sub folder in the assets folder with screenshots from my supabase database 1 of the code i used and another of schema visualizer showing my table.

i stuck with the basic idea for this one so that i could understand the overall concept better.

thanks to mdn,stackoverflow,css tricks for guides on adding the like/delete buttons and to wollivan for the demo on the initial setup code.

personally i would say this is best viewed on mobile then switch to desktop for the best effect.
